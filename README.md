# 👋 Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio

The purpose of this repo is to provide potential employers (such as yourself? 😁) with an overview of my career aspirations, an opportunity to view and verify my certifcations, and learn about some of the security tasks I perform in my current role. If you have any questions, or are looking for someone to join your cybersecurity team, please contact me by email at tomtrott1707@gmail.com 🫡

**If you're not sure where to start, why not read my career identity statement?**
