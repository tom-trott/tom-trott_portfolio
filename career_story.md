# Career Story

Throughout my career in technology, my ability to learn quickly and deliver excellent work has been recognised by managers and stakeholders, leading to regular progression. This document gives an executive summary of my employment history and how I have progressed through my various roles.

#### 2012, I start my technology career as IT Help Desk Assistant at Varndean College 

A year after graduating from university, I gained a one-year contract working on the IT help desk at Varndean College, Brighton, where I had done other temporary jobs since my graduation. My main responsibilities were simply to answer queries in person and over the phone, record issues, and update tickets. When the year contract ended, I moved to other administrative positions that opened up in different departments. Although these roles were not related to technology, they taught me essential soft skills, including time management, effective communication, and how to motivate people. 

#### 2015, I rejoin the help desk as IT Services Administrator

After a couple of years working in other teams, I rejoined the IT department as IT Services Administrator; this was a permanent role almost identical in responsibilities to my previous experience as IT Help Desk Assistant. However, over the course of one year, I quickly learned and then demonstrated the knowledge and skills required to become an equal member of the team, and I was promoted to the role of IT Technician. As I progressed in the role of IT Technician, I developed a great proficiency in administrating Google Workspace (or "GSuite" as it was then known), and this soon became my specialism. All issues involving Google Workspace were routed to me by default.

#### 2019, I am promoted to Learning Technologist

After two years in the role of IT Technician, the departure of two colleagues led to a shake-up in our team and the role of Learning Technologist was created especially for me. This was to reflect the extra responsibilities I had accumulated, such as managing our Moodle and Google Classroom setup. During my time as a technician, I had also begun to devise and deliver IT training and the new role of Learning Technologist was partly created to formalise this. My responsibility for IT training had developed organically due to my exceptional combination of technical and soft skills, which allowed me to empathise with the customer experiencing an issue, understand the technical details required to devise a solution, and the ability to craft compelling communication to embed the solution in the customer's mind.

#### 2022, I leave Varndean College for a new adventure at 15gifts

After three years as Learning Technologist, I felt I had reached the limit of where my career could progress at Varndean College. So, with a heavy heart, I started to apply for other IT support roles in the Brighton area. I joined 15gifts as IT Support Engineer, our team's only end-user computing support. As one of three technicians at the college, I had developed a specialism, but as the only end-user support at 15gifts, I needed to develop knowledge of every area of IT support and administration. I found this a challenge, but I was supported by my team. I relished the opportunity to become involved in areas that I had previously been unable to take a practical role in, such as cybersecurity and information management. Once again, I demonstrated my ability to learn the skills required to level up, and I received universally positive feedback from stakeholders across the business.

#### 2024, I am promoted to End-User Computing Engineer and begin a Cybersecurity Engineer apprenticeship

After two years at 15gifts, I requested a promotion. I felt I had excelled in my responsibilities and now met the level of knowledge and skills required for a more senior role. Leadership agreed, and I was promoted to my current role of End-User Computing Engineer. I also argued successfully to be enrolled on a Level 4 Cybersecurity Engineer apprenticeship.
